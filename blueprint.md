# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application designed to analyze student data from an Excel file. The application allows users to upload an Excel file, view the data in a table, ask questions about the data using a generative AI model, and view filtered data on a separate page.

## Features

- **Excel Upload:** Users can upload an Excel file containing student data.
- **Data Display:** The application parses the Excel file and displays the data in a tabular format.
- **Question Answering:** Users can ask questions about the data, and a generative AI model provides answers.
- **Bulk Analysis:** Users can get answers to a predefined list of questions with a single button click.
- **Filtered Data Page:** A dedicated page to display filtered student data in a card format, with each card representing a student.
- **UI:** The application has a simple and intuitive user interface with a clear separation of the upload and analysis sections.

## Current Plan

- [x] Create a new page `lib/filtered_data_page.dart` to display filtered data.
- [x] Update `lib/analysis_page.dart` to navigate to the `FilteredDataPage` when the "Get Data" button is clicked.
- [x] Pass the filtered data from the `AnalysisPage` to the `FilteredDataPage`.
- [x] Display the filtered data in a card format on the `FilteredDataPage`.
- [ ] Test the new filtered data page with a real Excel file.
